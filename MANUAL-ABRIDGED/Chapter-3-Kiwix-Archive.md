# Chapter 3: Creating your Kiwix Archive and offline Maps
## Section 1: Kiwix Archive
There will no doubt come a point when you will need to access knowledge that is otherwise unavailable in this manual, or the Linux MAN Pages. As well as 
this, there will no doubt come a point where maybe you'll need to know: "is this plant poisonous?" or "How do I do CPR?" or "How many quarts in one gallon?". In this case, Kiwix will come to your aid. Kiwix is a program that can download offline copies of various wikimedia projects, usually in the form of ".zim" files. These can be downloaded from Kiwix itself, OR they can be downloaded from https://farm.openzim.org 

I HIGHLY Recommend you mirror the following: 
1. Wikipedia ALL (There is a "no pictures" version that is 15GB, or a full version that is ~90GB in size. I highly recommend the latter, but the former will suffice in a pinch). 
2. Wikihow (This one is ~50GB)
3. Wikitionary
4. WikiMed
5. Project Gutenberg Library

To install Kiwix, and Marble (which will be discussed in the next section), run the following command: 

sudo chmod +x
